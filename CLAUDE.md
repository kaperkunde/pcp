# Working in this repo

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and the key-files
table, and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the encryption and tenancy
model. This file is the conventions that are easy to get wrong.

## Before pushing

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The pre-commit hook runs the first three; a red hook is fixed, not skipped
(`pnpm format` settles formatting; `--no-verify` is not an answer). Run the
Playwright projects your change touches (`pnpm exec playwright test
--project=<name>`; dependencies run first) — CI runs the whole suite on the
pull request, and nothing runs on a push.

## Branches and versions

Branch from `develop` and target it with pull requests; `main` only takes
merges from `develop`, and every push to it is a release (see "Branches and
releases" in CONTRIBUTING.md). A MAJOR or MINOR bump is `pnpm version:bump
minor|major` in a commit on `develop`; the patch and the `v*` tags belong to
the release workflow, never to a hand edit. Anything that states PCP's version
uses `PCP_VERSION` from `lib/core/version.ts`, not a literal.

## Boundaries

- `lib/core` is framework-free. No `next/*`, no React, no `lib/actions`,
  no `lib/server` (ESLint enforces it). Everything takes a `VaultContext`
  explicitly. If a core function needs something from the request, the
  caller passes it in (the public URL is the usual one).
- Client components must not import from `lib/core` except
  `lib/core/constants.ts` and `import type`. Anything else drags Prisma into
  the browser bundle and the build fails in webpack, not in the dev server.
- Secrets are decrypted in `lib/core/secrets.ts` and used in
  `lib/core/upstream.ts`. Nothing returns a secret value to an assistant;
  `revealSecret` is for the owner's own screen. An API endpoint's calls
  (`lib/core/endpoints.ts`, `lib/core/openapi/`) are handed their finished
  header by `upstream.ts` and never read a secret; `openapi/call.ts` scrubs
  the secret from what the API answers.
- What an assistant may do to an endpoint through the gateway
  (`lib/core/endpoint-admin.ts`) is narrower than what the owner may do, on
  purpose. It registers one through `register_server` with OpenAPI text or a
  schema URL (downloaded at once, public addresses only, and approved as that
  copy), which is a permission request like any new server: the owner is shown
  the address, the tools and the secret (by name), and nothing exists until
  they agree. A secret PCP does not hold yet is typed in by the owner on PCP's
  permission page, and its value never reaches the assistant. It changes a schema with edits (a JSON Patch, `openapi/patch.ts`)
  rather than resending it, and a changed document at a URL it proposed is not
  taken without the owner.
  It never changes a credential, never clears `publicOnly`, can only read and
  turn read-only on for an endpoint that is the owner's (it sends a secret, or
  private addresses are allowed), and a change others would see disables the
  endpoint until the owner enables it. Its changes go through
  `changeEndpoint`, which writes only the columns it is given and never the
  credential. Keep all of that when adding to it, and add a test for each new
  field an assistant can set.
- Memories (`lib/core/memories.ts`): an assistant writes its own
  (`/memories/…`) without asking, but anything other assistants would read
  (`/memories/shared/…`: creating, sharing, changing, renaming, deleting) is a
  permission request that shows the owner the whole text, writes nothing
  until they answer, and writes only what they were shown. Shared text stays
  short enough to read whole and free of characters that do not show on
  screen. The instructions name shared memories by path, and carry the text
  of the ones the owner marked to be read in every conversation (`always`):
  only the owner sets that mark, and an assistant's change to an always
  memory it keeps clears it, so every text in the instructions is one the
  owner read. Never a token's own memory the owner did not mark.
- Tool levels an assistant proposes for its token (`propose_tool_access`,
  `lib/core/access-requests.ts`) are written only by the owner's save on the
  request's page (`applyAccessRequest`), with what they chose there. No
  decision and nothing the assistant sends writes them, and blocked tools
  stay out of what it can name.
- `lib/core/openapi` never fetches a remote `$ref`, never follows a redirect
  on a call, and never lets an argument set a header or leave the base URL.
  A schema is untrusted input: new limits go in `openapi/limits.ts`.
- Server Actions live in `lib/actions/`, read the session with
  `requireContext()`, call `lib/core`, and return an `ActionState`. Forms
  use `useActionState`. Route handlers exist only for the gateway, OAuth
  (redirects and PCP's client metadata document) and the health check.
- The owner is asked by link only: a result hands the assistant a link to
  PCP's page and a check that waits (`check_permission`, `check_server`,
  `lib/core/owner-wait.ts`). No client prompts (elicitation) and no MCP Apps
  panel: Claude's apps stalled on the one and rebuilt the other stale (see
  ARCHITECTURE.md). Anything new that needs the owner works the same way.
- The single-user assumption lives in two places: `ownerVault()` and the
  setup page. Do not add a third.

## Cryptography

Do not add a way to read the vault without a credential — no admin key, no
environment-variable master key, no "forgot password" that does not use the
recovery key. If a feature seems to need one, it needs a different design.
New encrypted fields use `encryptString(ctx.dek, value, "<table>:<id>")` with
the row id as associated data, same as the existing ones.

## Database

Schema changes: edit `prisma/schema.prisma`, `pnpm db:generate`, `pnpm
db:migrate --name <change>`, commit the migration. Migrations apply at boot
through `lib/core/migrate.ts`; never edit an applied migration (the checksum
check refuses to start). Read the SQL Prisma writes: its table rebuild
(`RedefineTables`) drops the table, and migrations run in a transaction with
foreign keys on, so the drop cascades to every row that points at it. Drop a
column with `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` instead.

## Tests

- Unit tests sit next to the code (`*.test.ts`) and run with `pnpm test`.
  The core is tested against a scratch database (`lib/core/test-db.ts`).
- E2E specs are Playwright projects; a new spec gets a project in
  `playwright.config.ts` and a line in `e2e/README.md`. The fake upstream in
  `e2e/fixtures/upstream.ts` is the MCP server the suite talks to, and the
  pet store (a REST API with its OpenAPI schema) for API endpoints; extend it
  rather than reaching for a real service.
- Bar for new tests: high for new code (one when there is logic to pin
  down), low for regressions (red, then green, always).

## Copy

The owner is "you"; the assistant is "an assistant"; the thing PCP holds is
a "secret", the server it talks to is a "server", and an API added from an
OpenAPI schema is an "endpoint" ("API endpoints" in the UI); a note an
assistant keeps between conversations is a "memory", "shared" when every
assistant reads it. No operator
vocabulary in the UI: no "DEK", "grant", "KEK" outside code comments and
ARCHITECTURE.md.
